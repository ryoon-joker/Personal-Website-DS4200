    <p>Hello! My name is Ryan Masoud, and I am a second-year Computer Science and Business Administration student at Northeastern University’s Khoury College of Computer Science. I am passionate about applying technology and business principles to solve real-world problems. With a 3.7 GPA, I have made the Dean’s List and gained hands-on experience in software development, data analysis, and business operations through several internships.

        During my time at Business DNA, I collaborated with cross-functional teams to optimize data storage processes, reducing operational costs by 15%. I also identified a new market segment that resulted in a 10% boost in sales. At Sauce Capital, I co-developed a cloud kitchen delivery app, contributing to its success with over 5,000 downloads. My technical toolkit includes Java, Kotlin, Python, SQL, .NET, and JavaScript, with a deep understanding of object-oriented design and algorithms.

        Beyond academics and internships, I am passionate about trading stocks, researching crypto trends, and brainstorming entrepreneurial ideas. My hobbies also include soccer, meditation, gym workouts, and listening to techno music. This website showcases my interests and highlights some of the exciting things I am working on, blending my love for technology, finance, and entrepreneurship.</p>
