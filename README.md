Custom Fonts or Typography
The website uses Roboto, a modern font imported from Google Fonts. This font keeps the text clean and easy to read. It gives the site a professional and polished look. The font is applied across the entire site, including the body, headers, and navigation links. Using a single font ensures the site feels cohesive and consistent.

Background and Color Scheme Changes
The color scheme combines soft tones with bold accents. The body background is set to lightcyan. This creates a light and calming feel that is easy on the eyes. The header uses a bold teal to make it stand out and separate it from the content below. The footer has a dark slate gray background. This provides a strong and stable look at the bottom of the page.

Text in the header and footer is styled in white to ensure good contrast. The links in the footer are lightcyan to match the page’s color palette. When hovered over, the links change to white. This small change adds a subtle and interactive effect.

Custom Margins, Padding, and Layout Adjustments
Margins and padding are used to space elements properly and keep the layout neat. The body has 30px margins and 15px padding. This makes sure that the content doesn’t sit too close to the edges. The header has a 20px bottom margin to give it space from the main content. Padding inside the header ensures the text is properly aligned.

The main content section is centered using auto margins. It also has a maximum width of 600px to keep text readable on larger screens. The footer includes 20px of top margin and 10px of padding. This creates separation from the content above and keeps everything neatly aligned.
